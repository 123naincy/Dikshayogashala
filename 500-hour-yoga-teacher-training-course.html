                <h4>Visa Information

                </h4>
                <p>For your stay at Dikhshayogashala School, we recommend applying for the e-Tourist Visa only. Other
                    visa types, such as the 6-month or 3-month visas, are not applicable for our programs. If you plan

            <h4>Cancellation & Transfer Policy
            </h4>
            <p>Non-Refundable Fees
                Please note that all training fees are non-refundable once you have joined the course. The initial
                enrollment fee is also non-refundable; however, it allows you to transfer to another course within one
                year of enrollment, provided you adhere to our transfer policy.

            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4>Transfer Policy</h4>
            <p>Transferring to a different course month is permitted only once and requires a written notice at least 45
                days in advance of your original course start date. This notice should be sent via email. Please be
                aware that requests for cancellation or transfers made within 45 days of the course start date will not
                be accepted.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h4>Strict Non-Refund Policy


            </h4>
            <p>We uphold a strict non-refund policy. Requests for cancellations due to sickness, travel to other parts
                of India, or other unavoidable circumstances will not be accepted if made within 45 days of the course
                start date. In the event of cancellation or a no-show, the amount you have deposited will be forfeited.
            </p>
            <p>If you wish to transfer to another course month after your initial request, you will need to submit a new
                request for enrollment. Dikhshayogashala School reserves the right to refuse admission if the balance
                fee is not paid in cash upon arrival. Once you have checked in and commenced the course, any requests
                for cancellation will not be honored, and your full payment will be forfeited.</p>
            <p>We appreciate your understanding of these policies as they are designed to ensure a smooth and organized
                training experience at Dikhshayogashala School. If you have any questions or need further assistance,
                please feel free to reach out.</p>
