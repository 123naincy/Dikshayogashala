                            Rishabh is a Writer, Thinker, Seeker, Learner, Astrologer, and Mental health enthusiast. A
                            former copywriter and brand consultant, he has been called back to yoga—a path he began as a
                            child. Rishabh's yoga journey started at the age of 12 at Parmarth Niketan, where he learned
                            the foundational practices of yoga along with his cousins. He later deepened his practice at
                            Sivananda Ashram. Although he took a brief hiatus from yoga during his academic years, he
                            rekindled his passion by earning a diploma in yoga from Haridwar Sanskrit University. While
                            pursuing a career in writing and advertising, Rishabh continued his education, completing a
                            Bachelor’s and Master’s in Yoga from Uttarakhand Open University. Recently, Rishabh
                            participated in a Hatha Yoga Teacher Training Course to update his knowledge and reconnect
                            with his yogic path. Through asana, anatomy and philosophy in yoga, he seeks not only to
                            continue his own journey of self-discovery but also to help others recognize the voice of
                            their inner self and align with their true essence.
